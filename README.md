# shop-shop

## What it is 
Shop-Shop is an e-commerce app that allows shoopers to browse through the shop and purchase items that they like. 

## Technologies used
This app uses React to build the client side and the Apollo Server to run the back-end. This app also uses IndexedDB to allow for persistence of items in the shopping cart.

This app started off with starter code from the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, which I built off of.
